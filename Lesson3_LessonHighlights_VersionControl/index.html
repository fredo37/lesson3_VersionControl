                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This serves as the main repository for files. It’s extremely beneficial for large-scale projects where team members are required to work efficiently as a group. Version control allows each one of them access to all the files, make necessary changes to them, and then send them back to the repository. The latter action is what is known as ‘committing’ a file. All of this eliminates any possible file sharing problem that any team may encounter. The fact that each change is recorded as separate ‘versions’ of the same file gives web developers more freedom to experiment with the actual design of the web page. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A VCS is basically a computerized note taker. It records who alters files at all times through its revision history. It also records the exact time that those same files were modified as well as what actually changed with the files themselves. Finally, once they record all those changes they merge them onto one file. One of the advantages of using a VCS is that files cannot be overwritten once they are in the repository. Another one is the fact that people can all work on file at the same time without any problem. Also, the VCS allows for reverting back to an older version of the file if needed.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This type of repository is located on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. The repository itself can be separate versions of a project that are hosted on the web or any other kind of network. With these kinds of repositories the task is to work with others in managing the traffic of files and information in order to effectively share with others. The data that is constantly being pushed and pulled from different locations can be used anyone in the same project to solve whatever issue is at hand. Knowing how to add and remove certain repositories counts as part of the management of them as well.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An example of a VCS that was designed to aid in the day-to-day work of projects of any size while still providing stability and efficiency. Since this is a distributed VCS it allows every user to have “a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machines.”* This allows every user to work off of each other due to the close proximity of the data. There also cannot be a single point of failure by using this VCS and the overall processing speed of all actions within the program is much quicker. Perhaps one of the best things of using GIT is the fact that it will stop an unintentional overwrite of a file within the repository being used. I can only assume that this feature has saved many important pieces of work from accidentally being erased entirely. *Used class slides for definition</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to work efficiently and successfully in GIT a user needs to have a grasp on the prompts that the program uses to conduct its tasks. Among the basic commands are “git add” (adds changes made to files the current directory to the index), “git commit” (takes those changes made in the index and transfers them over to a new commit object), “git status” (shows the current status of the files in the working directory) and “git log” (shows the commits on a branch and then lists them for easy interpretation). All these and many more commands help make GIT the useful VCS that it is today.</p>
